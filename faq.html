              The NorthEast Regional Conference (NERC) is the largest of the
              SASE regional conferences, consistently averaging approximately
              500 students in attendance. It is the only regional conference to
              be planned and hosted exclusively by the Northeast Region as a
              collective of volunteers—a team of 16 students & alumni alongside
              the Regional Programing Coordinator— as opposed to a team at a
              single university. It offers a diverse variety of workshops,
              keynote speakers, networking events, and a career fair. These
              programs focus on educating and training AAPI students and
              professionals to empower our community to strive for diversity,
              inclusion, and in AAPI leadership in the workplace and beyond.
              Registration opens up in the spring!
